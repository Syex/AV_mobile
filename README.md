This is an KMM side project I once started to evaluate the feasibility of an idea, but then,
typically for a side project, abandoned.

## KMM shared code

* DI via Koin
* Shared resources via moko resources
* util method for converting time to a UI string with the `expect/actual` concept

## Android code

* Jetpack compose
* Functionality to scan a barcode with CameraX and Firebase MLKit
